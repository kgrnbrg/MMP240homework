        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Japan imports more than 930 million pounds of it each year - more than France, less than Italy. It's not a fad. There are coffee shops in Japan that date to at least the 1940s and traditions that reach back even further; it' a culture that prizes brewed coffee over espresso (although that's changing) and clarity over body. Coffee is as Japanese as baseball and beer.</em></p>
