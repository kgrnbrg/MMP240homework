	<h1>DESIREE DIAS-SCANDIFFIO</h1>
		<p>I am <b>not</b> a robot. I was born in <strong>Brazil</strong>, decades ago. Yes, the land of corruption and carnaval!! <em>YAY!</em> I came from a big city called Belo Horizonte, which means <em>"Beautiful Horizon"</em>, a very accurate and poetic name I must say. No sand beaches, but we have the best nightlife and beautiful waterfalls. With many attractions I surely recommend visiting Topo do Mundo. It's a restaurant, more of a bar, but you should go there for the view. And if you are have a brave soul, you should try Paragliding, its simply magical. <br/><p></p><img src="images/topodomundo.jpg"> <br> <a href="http://www.topodomundo.com/">Topo do Mundo</a> is perfect for watching the sunset, meditate, and why not, proposing while you at it.
